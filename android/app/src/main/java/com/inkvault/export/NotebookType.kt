/**
 * A known Ncode notebook product: its physical layout ([geometry], for true-size full-page export)
 * plus how its pages file on the backend ([code], [isPlanner]). Resolved from the Ncode book id —
 * the same id identifies the product across every physical copy, so the user designates a *type*
 * once per product (then labels each physical notebook separately; see NotebookEntity.title).
 *
 * Adding a product is one row in [BY_BOOK] once it's been measured: geometry from the corner/edge
 * traces (android/tools/calibrate_ncode.py), and — for a planner — its page→date map.
