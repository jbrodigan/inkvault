 * Everything the NeoLAB SDK needs to open a GATT link to one pen. A bare MAC is NOT enough: the
 * real `connect(sppAddress, leAddress, uuidVer, …)` needs three distinct things, and getting any of
 * them wrong fast-fails the connection (verified against the SDK source):
 *
 *  - [sppAddress] — the pen's stable NeoLAB-OUI identity (`9C:7B:D2:…`), derived from the
 *    advertisement's manufacturer data. The SDK keys/reports the pen by this; it is NOT the address
 *    Android shows for the device.
 *  - [leAddress]  — the BLE advertising address (often a rotating *random* address). This is what
 *    actually drives `connectGatt(TRANSPORT_LE)`.
 *  - [protocol]   — which GATT service the pen exposes. After connecting, the SDK looks up its
 *    service by this; pick the wrong one and `onServicesDiscovered` finds nothing and tears the link
 *    down. Decided by the advertised service UUID (V2 = `000019F1…`, V5 = `4f99f138…`). The LAMY
 *    safari is V5; the M1+ is V2.
